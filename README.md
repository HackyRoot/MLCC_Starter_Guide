# Machine Learning Crash Course Starter Guide
This guide provides technical and mathematical background required for Google's Machine Learning Crash Course(MLCC) to beginners.

## Why?
MLCC is great but sometimes people get stuck for weeks just because they don't have basic background in mathematics and python required for MLCC. Here I tried to help you kickstart your journey with Machine Learning.
